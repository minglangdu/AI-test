# AI evolution

Since a previous project didn't work so well, I'm now going to try out AI! 
Meant to be ai factions attacking each other. 

While this feels similar to my boid test thing, this will have many features and only be similar in the `sdl.cpp` code. 

I've decided to remove `include` and `lib` from the gitignore, so that I can download it them better.
